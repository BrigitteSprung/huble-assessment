# Huble Digital Assessment

As a technical exercise, please could you recreate the first three modules of the following [homepage](https://www.qubit.com)  (please donâ€™t recreate the menu);
1. Banner module
2. Logo module
3. Stats module
 
### Here are some instructions:
- Please do not re-create the whole page. Only create the 3 modules (sections) described above (more details will be provided below).
- Please do not copy any of the code (from the site or from the internet), please rebuild yourself.
- Please recreate the animations and hover over effects found in the modules.
- You may use any third party libraries such as jQuery, Vue.js etc but all your own code should be handwritten.
- Think about your module construction in terms of reusability. Make it flexible where appropriate.
- Please place all work on one page/template
